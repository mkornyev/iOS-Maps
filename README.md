# iOS-Maps
Working repo for the iOS Maps project. 


## Setup

* run pod install

### Notes 

* Take a look at our Firebase instance to watch updates happed live in the database 
* The ContentView sometimes fails to refresh the AddTrip view: meaning you might have to restart the app after ending a trip to create a new one
